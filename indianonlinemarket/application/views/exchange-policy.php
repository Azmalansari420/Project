                        <p><strong>Eligibility for Exchanges</strong><br>
                        Exchanges are allowed within 24 hours of receiving your order.<br>
                        The item must be unused, unwashed, and in the original condition with all tags and packaging intact.<br>
                        Exchange is eligible only in case of size issue.<br>
                        Items that show any signs of wear or alteration will not be accepted.<br><br>
                        <strong>How to Initiate an Exchange</strong><br>
                        Login to your Account. You'll find an exchange button next to your respective order.<br>
                        Click on the button to initiate an exchange request. (Please note:- The exchange button will be visible 24 hours after the order has been delivered.) <br><br>

                        <strong>Exchange Process</strong><br>
                        If you wish to exchange an item, the ₹100 charge will apply, and we will ship the new item to you once we have received and processed the returned product.<br>
                        Non-Returnable & Non-Exchangeable Items
                        Certain items are not eligible for exchange, including but not limited to:<br>

                        If you received a damaged or defective item, please notify us within 24 hours of receiving the product. We will provide a replacement at no additional cost, after verifying the issue.<br><br>


                        <strong>Final Note</strong><br>

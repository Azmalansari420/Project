						<h2 class="text-primary srvh2">What Is A Hand Operated Siren</h2>
						<p class="jsticnt">While we live in the modern world it produces more advanced electronic sirens which work
							automatically, in some areas or industries or factories hand operated sirens are still in use. A Hand
							operated siren is a type of siren that has a distinct handle at the back of the main head. When you rotate
							that handle it produces a sound which as a warning sign for people working there that a fire emergency has
							occurred at your place everyone gets to a safe place. What makes hand operated sirens different from other
							types of electric and automatic sirens is that it can be used at the time of no electricity when all the
							automatic and electronic equipment fail to respond even at that time you can warn everyone about the fire
							emergency and save them from any casualty. </p>

						<p class="font-weight-bold">Range of the hand operated siren is from</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>
								<p class="jsticnt">0.5 kilometer</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="jsticnt">1.0 Kilometer</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="jsticnt">1.5 Kilometer</p>
							</li>

						</ul>


						<h2 class="text-primary srvh2">How Does Hand Operated Siren Works</h2>

						<p class="jsticnt">As from the name it depicts that its hand operated so there is no need for any kind of
							electric input since it would be working with your energy and intensity by which you will be rotating the
							handle a few times to produce a sound slowly getting louder with every turn you make. It has a motor
							installed inside that drives the shaft which is attached to a rotor, also called a chopper or fan, to both
							the ends. Every rotor is surrounded by a stator, a sort of casing, which has a various number of holes
							that are rectangular in shape. </p>

						<p class="jsticnt">Each of the blades of the hand operated siren draws and forces the air out through the
							slots inside the stator while the plates at the end of each of the blades stop or interrupt the flow. As a
							result, it creates rarefied and alternating compressed air pressure that produces a deafening sound. </p>
						<p class="jsticnt">In easy works the rotation of the handle generates electricity which powers the sound of
							the siren, the reach and intensity of the siren increase with the increase of speed of rotation. </p>

							power cuts or no electricity, on our advice one must have both hand operated siren and electric siren so

							anything. </p>

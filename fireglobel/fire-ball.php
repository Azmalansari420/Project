							The Best Fire Ball Extinguisher in India</h1>
						<p class="text-black lead"></p>
						<p class="jsticnt">Global Fire & Safety services are foremost providers fire ball extinguisher in india ,
							we have been in the business of providing fire safety equipment which includes fire extinguisher ball used
							to instantly eliminate any kind of fire(A,B and C)</p>


						<h2 class="text-primary srvh2">What Are Fire Extinguishing Balls?</h2>

						<p class="jsticnt">The fire extinguishing balls which are available today are not made of glass unalike old
							times, but typically constructed with a foam casing wrapped in PVC. These products react instantly to heat
							and flames quickly, causing the triggers which are embedded in the unit to respond and disperse the dry
							chemical which is locked inside.</p>
						<p class="jsticnt">To fight a fire, it must be thrown or rolled directly into the flames, where it will
							burst and spread a dry-powdered fire extinguishing agent which will do the work of fire eliminating. Mono
							ammonium phosphate is commonly used as a inside the fire extinguisher ball which extinguishes flames of
							Class A, B or C fires. They are also sometimes effective, without any human interference.</p>
						<p class="jsticnt">This product is generally covered from brightly colored wrappers that denote their use
							and serve as a warning to those who may attempt to move the device.</p>


						<h2 class="text-primary srvh2">How Do Fire Extinguishing Balls Work?</h2>

						<p class="jsticnt">Different models of fireballs can function in some different ways, but the basic idea is
							the same. An activator or trigger strip is fitted onto the ball’s outer casing, which constantly holds the
							dry fire extinguishing agent inside it. When the activator or trigger is exposed to extreme heat of the
							flames for more than a certain period of time, the outer casing will burst open and disperse a cloud of
							chemical powder immediately in the area of fire. A fire extinguishing ball can usually put out the flames
							in a radius between 4 meters to 5 meters. An audible warning such as a bang or other loud noise is set
							inside in order to alert those nearby.</p>
						<h2 class="text-primary srvh2">The devices work as passive protection in 3 different ways:</h2>

						<ul class="list">
							<li>
								<p class="jsticnt">Automatic Flame detection – Trigger occurs when heat or flames are sensed by the
									activator embedded on the surface.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="jsticnt">Alarm – a loud noise alerts those nearby that there is a fire and fire ball is going
									to burst. </p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="jsticnt">Fire extinguisher – the dry chemical agent inside the fire ball reacts quickly and
									effectively to suppress the fire in the surrounding area within its radius.</p>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h2 class="text-primary srvh2">Specific Benefits</h2>

						<p class="jsticnt">This type of device is free from any kind of maintenance and will typically provide you
							about five or more years of dependable coverage before needing a replacement. Traditional extinguishers
							ways and devices need to be taken care of and can become costly to maintain and repair.</p>
						<p class="jsticnt">Fire extinguishing balls are effective in both the manners, passive and active manner
							that is, mounted on the wall or ceiling and/or thrown or rolled into the flames. Flexibility and ease of
							use makes it a wise choice for residential places.</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>
								<p class="jsticnt">When activated, the dry chemical fire extinguishing agent inside the fire
									extinguisher ball is typically non-toxic and harmless to any living things and environment.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="jsticnt">Various fire extinguishing balls can be rolled or thrown into a fire which is spread
									into a large area to help controlling or eliminating the spread. </p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="jsticnt">Although the fire extinguisher ball must be stored inside so that it has to be
									protected from various elements, though it can be effectively used to actively fight outside fires as
									well.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="jsticnt">Many of the models available on the market are simple to dispose of when their
									expiration date has elapsed. The chemical agent is usually mono ammonium phosphate, which can be
									safely used as garden fertilizer when mixed with water. And its plastic or foam outer core can usually
									be recycled, depending on the specifications of your local recycling program.</p>

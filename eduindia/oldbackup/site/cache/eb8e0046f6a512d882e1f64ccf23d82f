They were extremely technologically advanced, and gifted their knowledge and technologies to the Tau'ri, who have used them to defend Earth and her interests. Ida is the name of a galaxy that was home to the Asgard.At one point, the Ancients also inhabited space in the Ida galaxy or may have been made aware of the Asgard by way of the Destiny.The galaxy is approximately 4 million light years from the Milky Way. The Asgard were a highly developed, philanthropic race with colonies in both the the Ida and Othala galaxies which visited and protected humans on Earth and elsewhere. It is not round like the Earth, does not spin on its axis, and does not revolve around the sun. THOR : They were discovered on an isolated planet in our home galaxy some years ago. The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our Solar System, with the name describing the galaxy's appearance from Earth: a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye.The term Milky Way is a translation of the Latin via lactea, from the Greek γαλαξίας κύκλος (galaxías kýklos, "milky circle"). The Asgard were an alien race from another galaxy, who influenced the Milky Way galaxy in the fights against the Goa'uld, Replicators, and Ori. Let's remember that the translation of Bifrost is closer to "shimmering" than "rainbow." Prerequisite: Bring Down the Sky (Mass Effect) The Asgard finally defeated the Replicators, with much needed assistance from the Tau'ri. re: Is there anywhere in Louisiana where the Milky Way can be seen by the naked eye? Part of the Alliance of Four Great Races, the Asgard were among the most advanced races in the universe, rivaled only by the Ancients, the Nox, and possibly the Furlings. When interacting with early humans, they posed as beneficent protective gods, eventually giving rise to the Norse mythology on Earth. Asgard was home to the Asgardians, such as Thor and their leader Odin who were worshiped as gods by the human Nords. They assumed the role of the Ancients as protectors of the Milky Way when the latter passed from existence and in turn passed that role down to the Tau'ri, to whom they gifted all of their knowledge and latest technology. Although the Asgard have had a presence in the Milky Way Galaxy for a very long time (and hence it would be logical to assume they encountered the Replicators there) Thor explictly states that they were first encountered in the Ida Galaxy. This gives them great superiority over most other space-faring races in both the Milky Way and Pegasus Galaxy. I think the Milky Way is one way to Asgard. Quote: Scholar Andy Orchard posits that Bifröst may mean "shimmering path." Part of the Alliance of Four Great Races, they were among the most advanced races in the universe, matched only by the Ancients, the No… <br>  "Milky Way" by Andrius Lik Andrius has had more than 20 solo exhibitions during his artist career which have been held in the United States of America, Denmark, Germany, Lithuania, Hungary, Finland, Denmark and Moscow, Russia. It is named for the home of the Norse gods; three of its planets are named after members from the pantheon. <br> <br>The creators were not present. (SG1: "The Fifth Race", "Enemies") The stargate seen on Othala seems to be a second generation stargate, the same type found in the Milky Way. Let's assume for the moment that Asgard is in the Milky Way. <br> <br>Posted by Capt ST on 7/20/15 at 12:50 am to Asgard Device We were running in from offshore about 24 hours ago, there was a 3-4mile stretch I couldn't take my eyes off the sky.  <br>"Milky Way" by Andrius Lik Andrius has had more than 20 solo exhibitions during his artist career which have been held in the United States of America, Denmark, Germany, Lithuania, Hungary, Finland, Denmark and Moscow, Russia. As the technology was shared by the Asgard with the Tau'ri after their contributions in defeating the Replicators, the Earth-designed Prometheus- and Daedalus-class battlecruisers are also protected by Asgard shields. If you try to reach Andromeda from anywhere in the Milky Way, even at the edge closest to each other, it would take millions of years to reach the other galaxy, and that's at the speed of light. <br> <br>The Ori were attempting to invade the Milky Way galaxy via Supergates, and the Asgard gave military support to the fight to halt their spread into this galaxy. <br>";s:7:"keyword";s:26:"is asgard in the milky way";s:5:"links";s:3116:"<a href='https://eduindiafoundation.org/site/viewtopic.php?efa19b=annie%27s-gummies-vegan'>Annie's Gummies Vegan</a>,

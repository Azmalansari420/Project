And behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom, and the earth shook; and the rocks were split, and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised; and coming out of the tombs after His resurrection they entered the holy city and appeared to many.  The resurrection of Jesus is the monumental event of human history. When Jesus rose from the dead, he confirmed his identity as the Son of God and his work of atonement, redemption, reconciliation, and salvation. Matthew Henry explains in his commentary, Jesus was nailed to the cross between the third and the sixth hour, that is, between nine and twelve o’clock. First Peter 3:18 says that the Spirit raised Jesus from the dead (see also Romans 1:4, and note that Romans 8:11 clearly says that God will resurrect believers “through His Spirit”). Therefore everyone belonging to the church is obliged to confess the truth about the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, because the church was literally born in His Resurrection. Did Jesus Christ really resurrect? Did Jesus really resurrect people? <br> <br>His death and resurrection are the focal point of Scripture and the most important events in the history of the world. So, Jesus was crucified on a Friday, the first day, remained in the tomb through Saturday, the second day, and rose on Sunday morning, the third day. Paul’s transformation: Paul and Jesus Christ were contemporaries. Let's look at facts we know of when Jesus died.. About the Author. Jesus resurrected Lazarus, who had been dead for four days. The Urantia Book Paper 189 The Resurrection 189:0.1 (2020.1) SOON after the burial of Jesus on Friday afternoon, the chief of the archangels of Nebadon, then present on Urantia, summoned his council of the resurrection of sleeping will creatures and entered upon the consideration of a possible technique for the restoration of Jesus. Destroy this body, and in three days, I will raise it up. Jesus was a well-known figure in Israel. And who did Peter and Paul resurrect? <br> <br>Here are some logical conclusions: 1. If Jesus did not resurrect in his body then he did not in fact raise up “this temple” his body. Easter – When did Jesus Resurrect? <br> The first scriptural intimation of Jesus’ death and resurrection was written some six millennia ago, 4,000 years before the birth of Christ. Jesus could be ten years senior to Paul. Widow of Zarephath's Son. <br> <br>3. Jesus lingered where Martha had met him, and when Martha returned home and told her sister Mary that Jesus was coming, Mary left to meet him. His burial site was known by many people. The resurrection of Jesus, or anastasis, is the Christian belief that God raised Jesus on the third day after his crucifixion at Calvary as first of the dead, starting his exalted life as Christ and Lord. And he did. "The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and after three days rise again" (Mark 8:31; see also Matthew 17:22; Luke 9:22).Those who consider the resurrection of Christ unbelievable will probably say that Jesus … He is an author, radio talk show host, and a national and international speaker on apologetics, cults, world religions, Bible, theology, and current issues. Galatians 1:1 says that the Father raised Jesus from the dead. The resurrection of Jesus is foundational to the Christian faith, and yet, oftentimes, we only give it real thought around the Easter season. Jesus knew by revelation that He was God's Holy One prophesied by David. Yet, why he needed to resurrect was not fully revealed until the Apostle Paul. Here are all ten Bible episodes of people God raised back to life. What Time Did Jesus Die? “For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.” – … <br> <br>Jesus views death as a temporary sleep because His Father has the power to resurrect anyone from death. People tend to think or act like the Bible simply comes to a stop after Jesus is raised from the dead. He then removed all the righteous dead from paradise and took them with Him to heaven. And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up His spirit. Let us first examine the case of the empty tomb. In the First Epistle to the Corinthians chapter 15, ἀνάστασις νεκρῶν is used for the resurrection of the dead. Those accounts are not mythical; they are set in real places at specific times. But the resurrection of Jesus is so important that Paul writes, “If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins” (1 Corinthians 15:17). Three facts must be reckoned with when investigating the Resurrection: the empty tomb, the transformation of the Apostles, and the preaching of the Resurrection originating in Jerusalem.

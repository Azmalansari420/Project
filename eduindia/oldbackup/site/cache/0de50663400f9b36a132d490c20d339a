Suddhodana that was buddhas fathers name your welcome! His queen Maha Maya was childless for a long time until one day she dreamt of a white elephant coming out from the right side of her abdomen. Siddhattha was his personal name and it means "wish-fulfilled". King Suddhodana (Buddha's Father) King Suddhodana , Buddha’s father, was the king of Kapilavatthu. Mother. In later renditions of the life of the Buddha, Śuddhodana was often referred to as a king, though that status cannot be established with confidence and is in fact disputed by modern scholarship. Gotama is his family name. Mahamaya was born in Devadaha, Nepal. How I have longed for this moment!" Śuddhodana, meaning "he who grows pure rice," was a leader of the Shakya, who lived in an oligarchic republic on the Indian subcontinent, with their capital at Kapilavastu. Yasodhara took Rahula to see his father, who was now the Buddha. During the time of Buddha the ruler of Kosala, King Pasenadi ruled a bigger more powerful Kingdom than that of the Sakyan Clan of Buddha. He was called Siddhartha Gautama in his childhood. Others have had the benefit of his doctrine, but not his father nor his relatives." The Buddha devoted himself to teaching and attracted hundreds of followers. What was the Buddhas fathers name? Suddhodana thereby reached the second stage of enlightenment and became a "once-returner" (sakadāgāmī, J.i.90; cf. He was the leader of the Shakya Clan. Buddha's father's name was king ''Suddhodana'' ... No there are no.All Buddhas were male. Most courts in ancient India had a Body of men called ‘king makers’ (rājakattāro, D.II,233). </p> <p>At the end of the meal offering, Suddhodana's mind/heart having been readied, the Buddha gave his father the king a gradual discourse. He was also the father of Siddhartha Gautama, who later became The Buddha.  A prophecy indicated that, if the child stayed at home, he was destined to become a world ruler. Father Suddhodana was the father of Siddhartha, the king of Kapilvastu. His father, King Suddhodana, was leader of a large clan called the Shakya. Then the Sakyamuni took a seat opposite his father, and the king gazed eagerly at his son. At the end of the meal offering, Suddhodana's mind/heart having been readied, the Buddha gave his father the king a gradual discourse. Then the Sakyamuni took a seat opposite his father, and the king gazed eagerly at his son. </p> <p>His wife, the devoted Yasodhara, became a nun and disciple. Buddha's original name was Siddhatta Gotama and he was a prince. Rahula, his son, became a novice monk at the age of seven and spent the rest of his life with his father. His mother, Queen Maya, died shortly after his birth....When Prince Siddhartha was a few days old, a holy man prophesied the Prince would be either a great military conqueror or a great spiritual teacher.

Māyā and King Suddhodhana did not have children for twenty years into their marriage. His name is Maathru Divya Puthra (Mother god) .

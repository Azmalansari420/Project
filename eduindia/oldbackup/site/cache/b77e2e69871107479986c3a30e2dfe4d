I would say that Gandalf sees the eye, whereas Boromir does not is due to the heightened sensitivity we would expect from a wizard. -Gandalf. --TarElessar 07:00, 2 September 2014 (UTC) Gandalf didn't touch the Ring, he used the throng (as he did in the book btw) to give it to Frodo from the fireplace. Bilbo was meant to find the Ring.  -Gandalf. Gandalf: So do all who live to see such times. 11. Originally posted by Grond Alas, I must retract this statement for in the Council of Elrond, Gandalf spoke, "...The Nine, the Seven, and the Three had each their proper gem. Accepting the ring would not only be exactly the opposite of Gandalf’s mission, it would also have grievous harm for Gandalf personally. Gandalf touched it, more than likely skin contact as to why you see him toss the ring down and recoil from it, to place the ring in something protective to give to Bilbo. When Frodo arrives he finds Gandalf muttering to himself. His Orcs have multiplied. Bombadil wore it, and the ring disappeared rather than Tom disappearing. Hunter Young 8,887,130 views. As I already have written, Gandalf touches the ring in the first one with a forceps. Gandalf tells Frodo that the ring (and all of Bilbo's other property) is now his and he must keep it safe and secret. In the same chapter he tells Frodo that he just had confirmed that the ring was indeed the One Ring with the fire test, but that he was already pretty sure that It was the real deal. Did Gandalf really touch the ring in the books? Anybody remember this? Always remember, Frodo, the Ring is trying to get back to its master. I'm at work so can't get to the books at the moment.. (One Ring to rule them all, one Ring to find them, one Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them!) Gandalf walks back inside. In which case, you were also meant to have it. The Istari came to Middle Earth to help the free peoples counter Sauron. Scared of What's Behind You: In Moria, Gimli thinks that the Fellowship is scaring off the orcs, naturally it's the Balrog that they're really reacting to. Gandalf: [speaking the words engraved on the Ring] Ash Nazg Durbatuluk, Ash Nazg Gimbatul, Ash Nazg Thrakatuluk, Agh Burzum-ishi Krimpatul. Also, IRCC, it might have said somewhere in the books that if Saruman took the ring, he would have enough power (unlike hobbits and men who just disappear when they wear it) to wield it properly and defeat Sauron, but that would mean a new evil sorcerer would replace the current one. When Isildur had cut the Ring from Sauron's hand, it was burning hot, and so Isildur was able to transcribe the inscription before it faded. Gandalf first learned of the Ring-inscription when he read the account that Isildur had written before marching north to his death and the loss of the Ring. When Gandalf almost touches the One Ring and senses Sauron in it. There are other forces at work in this world Frodo, besides the will of evil. <br> <br>His fortress of Barad-Dur is rebuilt in the land of Mordor. He is seeking it, seeking it, all his thought is bent on it. Frodo took it from his breeches-pocket, where it was clasped to a chain that hung from his belt. [the light darkens and the air rumbles] Elrond : Never before has any one dared utter the words of that tongue here in Imladris. The spirit of Sauron endured. His life force is bound to the Ring and the Ring survived. I think the movie has greatly heightened some idea that if Gandalf touches the ring he'll become ensnared in its power. 13. Samwise touched it and wore it as a necklace for sometime until Frodo was back. Not so the One. Powerful wizard, mystical ancient, and befriender of hobbits, Gandalf is one of the most beloved characters in J.R.R. But that's not necessary for the page anymore. It's been a few years since I last re-read the books, but I can't remember if he's correct. The movie makes much of the fact that Gandalf has Bilbo put the ring in an envelope and then throws the envelope in the fire, so that Gandalf never touches the ring. Inspired by this question here, not sure about the LOTR novels (no copy of my books with me) but, in the movies Gandalf touches the Ring once after Bilbo drops it, and gets a vision immediately of Sauron's eye. Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatulûk, agh burzum-ishi krimpatul! Tolkien's high fantasy literary epic The Lord of the Rings, his novel The Hobbit, and The Silmarillion. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. A work colleague claims that the movie is better, in some key scenes, one of them being because Gandalf touches the ring in the book, but refuses to touch it in the movie.

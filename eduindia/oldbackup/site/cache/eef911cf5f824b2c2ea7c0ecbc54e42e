He noticed that the sun was in Dakshinayana and hence it was not the best time to embrace death. </p> <p>So despite being badly injured, he decided to die only when the Sun was Uttarayan, that is … Due to that sin, he was also suffering on the arrow-bed. 745… Up until that time India was technologically very advanced. Bhishma Lay On The Arrow Bed For 58 Days. Yudhisthira was lamenting that for his sake so many men were slaughtered in the Battle of Kurukshetra. When Arjuna attacked him in the Mahabharata, while Bhishma's attention was caught by the reincarnated Shikhandi, the attack made injured him badly. </p> <p>Bhismadeva's Instructions on his death bed of arrows. Originally named as 'Devavrata', he was the eighth son of the Kuru King Shantanu and the river goddess Ganga. Then Arjuna, stringing the Gandiva or the bow, shot three arrows into the earth for the support of Bhishma… Bhishma chose his date of death and waited for 58 days. However, he had the boon not to die against his wish. It briefly elaborates on how the mortally wounded Bhishmadeva, who was lying on a bed of many arrows, pacified the aggrieved Maharaja Yudhisthira. Finally Bhishma gave up the fight, focusing his life force and breath, sealing the wounds, and waiting for the auspicious moment to give up his body on the arrow bed. Next he asked for water, since he was thirsty. Grandsire Bhishma’s body was pierced all over by arrows which served as his bed.  There can be violent in nature, but not the violation of its law. Bhishma Pitamaha had attained a boon from his father Shantanu that death … </p> <p>The moment she entered the battle field, Bhishma Pitamah recognized her. Bhishma was blessed with a boon from his father that he could choose the time of his death or he may remain immortal till he desires. He was related to both the Pandavas and the Kauravas through his half-brother, Vichitravirya. Hence, at the time of death, the earth did not accept the body of Bhishma, and hence, the arrow-ridden death bed was provided to him. </p> <p>Thus, as was preordained (Mahadeva's boon to Amba that she would be the cause of Bhishma's death) Shikhandi, that is, Amba reincarnated was the cause of Bhishma's fall. </p> <p>accept Bhishma's last pranam! Up until that time India was technologically very advanced. Bhishma’s bed of arrows was also his deathbed in a war that is said to have occurred around 6000 BC. Bhishma remarked joyfully - "What a fitting pillow for a warrior like me - a pillow to match the bed !". Arjuna once, more, struck a mighty arrow right through the earth, and Ganga maiya surged up to pour cool water in the parched mouth of her beloved son. </p> <p>All kinds of soft and beautiful pillows were brought for Bhishma, but he waved them aside as not fit for the bed of a hero, and turned to Arjuna. He did wait for about 58 nights for the winter solstice or first day of Uttarayana to give up his body on the arrow bed. Bhishma on a Bed of Arrows.The area consisting of Aihole, Pattadakkal and Badami served as a crucible of temple architecture during the reign of Chalukyas.The picture below is one of the many scenes sculpted on the pillars of the Virupaksha temple at Pattadakkal, Karnataka. According to historical record, Bhishma’s bed of arrows was also his deathbed in a war that is said to have occurred around 6000 BC. This way, Shikhandi became the reason for Bhishma's death and she took her revenge as she had vowed. Hence he waited 58 days for Uttarayana while lying on the bed of arrows. You know, Lord, for what secret sorrow on a bed-of-arrows child-like lies Bhishma night after day. But, these are not the logical reason for his arrow-bed… </p> <p>Lying on the bed of arrows, Bhisma asked for a pillow to keep his head. </p> <p>He lay blood soaked on a bed of arrows. </p> <p>Grandsire Bhishma’s body was pierced all over by arrows which served as his bed. In Shrimad-Bhagavatam (1.9.27) Bhishma instructs King Yudhishthira in the following dharma: dana-dharma, or public acts of charity, raja-dharma, or the duties of a king, Why alone, unhonoured lie in living-death… In the Mahabharata, Bhishma was well known for his pledge of celibacy. The war was so devastating to India that the country never recovered, according to Amar Evry, President of the Vedic Cultural Center in Toronto. O progenitor of my dynasty! </p> <p>Stand before my eyes, Your child, at death's door, begs Your last loving blessing. </p>";s:7:"keyword";s:29:"bhishma on death bed of arrow";s:5:"links";s:12218:"<a href='https://eduindiafoundation.org/site/viewtopic.php?efa19b=one-heart-to-win'>One Heart To Win</a>,

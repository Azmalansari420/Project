Hank's heroics killing Tuco Salamanca, Walt's distributor, earn him a promotion and a part-time assignment at the DEA's El Paso office, but also leave him enduring debilitating anxiety attacks. When Jack and his crew rolled up in Ozymandias, I think Hank realized a few things in the minutes leading up to his death.. Mostly that Walt was in way over his head. But hanks narcissism can't handle it. Hank, when he found out, Walt was out. After a bit of small talk, Walt asks Hank if he knows anything about the tracker. Ah yes, it would be the first episode if I remember right.. *** Major Spoiler Warning *** In the back half of the final season, Hank finally gets Walt cornered. He doesn't learn that until after he and Marie watch the DVD. (paraphrased "My other favorite W.W.") and I remember Hank's joking accusation of Walt being heisenberg and their conversation about … Walt begins to worry that Hank has figured out his true identity. [Breaking Bad] Hank's Realization (Original Version) - YouTube I think you have it wrong about Walt tipping the DEA to save Hank's life and I don't think that Hank knows yet that Walt's money was used for his treatment.

I think Hank hated Heisenberg but still kinda loved Walt -- at first when he found out Walt he didn't even know what to do. He was Hank’s buddy and they had dinner together all the time. Hank Finds Out About Walt.  </p> <p></p> <p>Walt spins a long, thought-out tale, saying that Hank, not Walt, is the ruthless, murderous drug lord, and that he threatened and blackmailed Walt into using his chemistry skills to make meth. Over the years, Hank has investigated the source of the high-quality blue meth of "Heisenberg," Walt's underworld alter ego. P.S. 4 years ago. The two of them shared heart-to-hearts, too.

And how do you even begin to make sense of the future when things change so fast? If Britain ever has a Prime Minister like Chavez I would be so over the moon. With a distinguished career in finance spanning over three decades, Marja has successfully navigated the male-dominated business world and is passionate about coaching women on how to be taken seriously, to be heard, and to get what they want at work. ... Childrens would be X-Social and therefore wouldn't be exposed to this realistic world. Seriously as we all know they are some of the most insecure creatures in our world and they really create Narcissistic magic to appear normal.

"Tangerine" and "Dazed and Confused" are the only Led Zeppelin songs with lyrics that credit Page as the sole songwriter. General Commentman, go see almost famous. plus almost famous has like 235089 other zeppelin songs so its worth it. <br> <br>Although it's tremendously good. In addition to being credited as the songwriter on all Led Zeppelin releases, Page claims to be responsible for the lyrics: "I'd written it after an old emotional upheaval and I just changed a few of the lyrics for the new version". The fact it's on Zep 3 is fantastic as it is a perfect fit. <br> <br>The Tangerine Zoo interview Psychedelic rock band The Tangerine Zoo formed in 1967 in Swansea, Massachusetts, near Boston. Although writers do not question who composed the music for the song,  there is some disagreement over who wrote the lyrics.  if that doesnt send shivers down your spine than youre a soul-less freak. Brian from Brantford, Canada Tangerine and The Rain Song are so masterful it's crazy. It even sounds like it was written in about ten minutes. <br> <br>the most poignant scene in it is the bus driving off into the sunset at the end of the movie with tangerine playing. He: Tangerine, she is all they claim With her eyes of night and lips as bright as flame Tangerine, when she dances by, senoritas stare and caballeros sigh And I've seen toasts to Tangerine Raised in every bar across the Argentine As for the comment about Stairway to Heaven being the only song that can keep you entertained for over 8 minutes, i have to say, Achilles last stand, also by the mighty led-zeppelin is over 11 minutes long and is also very entertaining and captivating. Here’s the real answer! Find album reviews, stream songs, credits and award information for Risky Business - Original Soundtrack on AllMusic - 1984 - A fairly good cross-section of the soundtrack… Lyrics to 'Tangerine' by Frank Sinatra. Dominguez is also listed in the writing credits on the album. Tangerine is the second song on side two of Led Zeppelin III. Lisa from Blountville , Tn This was the last song Pagey wrote alone, it was suppose to have been a left over from Jimmy's Yardbird's days and ,his reminisce of a love from his session days with a girl by the name of Jackie De Shannon (who he played on a session of hers 1966' I think).Or at least that what I've read.Beautiful song none the less. A sweet unassuming love song with great acoustic work thru out. The songs really move you. … Bryan from Brunswick, Ga Considering that Page wrote this when with the Yardbirds, Tangerine probably refers to a young lady in Britian with that as a name in the fine hippie times of then. Jimmy Page wrote this song while he was still in The Yardbirds and properly finished it while he was in Led Zeppelin in 1969 or 1970. Led Zeppelin’s “Tangerine” was released on their 1970 album Led Zeppelin III.Jimmy Page wrote the songs years earlier and The Yardbirds even attempted to record it. Tangerine is song that's meaning should be blatantly obvious to anybody.  The song composed by Johnny Mercer was covered by: Bob Eberly, 1929 Jimmy Dorsey, 1936 Hal McIntyre, 1942 Dave Brubeck, 1946 Zoot Simms, 1949 Among others Recorded in 1970, it is included on the second, more acoustic-oriented side of Led Zeppelin III (1970). <br>";s:7:"keyword";s:28:"who wrote the song tangerine";s:5:"links";s:5664:"<a href='https://eduindiafoundation.org/site/viewtopic.php?efa19b=The-Law-of-the-Land'>The Law Of The Land</a>,

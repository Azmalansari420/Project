It is a soft, silvery white metal with a bluish tinge, known to the ancients in bronze, an alloy with copper. Titin is the largest known protein, consisting of 26,926 amino acids.The molecular weight of the mature protein is approximately 2,993,451.39 Da, and it has a theoretical pI of 6.01 The protein's empirical chemical formula is C 132983 H 211861 N 36149 O 40883 S 693.It has a theoretical instability index (II) of 39.69, indicating that it would be stable in a test tube. The name of the protein titn is 189,819 letters long and the longest one in English. Titin, which has Ig-folds itself, binds directly to the Ig-fold domain of both A- and B-type lamins in vitro, with a slight preference for lamin A (Zastrow et al., 2006).Titin binding was mildly but selectively sensitive to specific laminopathy-causing missense mutations in the Ig-fold domain of lamin A, suggesting these mutations might perturb lamin–titin connections. Protein powder tin box. Then these masses will be used to calculate the number of moles of each element that combined to form the oxide of tin. The length of the entire word is Chemical Name of Titin–The Longest Word This is the complete chemical name of titin—the largest known protein. Here it is: In the current implementation, TIN-X supports exploration of data for G-protein coupled receptors, kinases, ion channels, and nuclear receptors. Everybody calls him Tintin in those books and/or cartoons. <br> TINAG (Tubulointerstitial Nephritis Antigen) is a Protein Coding gene. <br> <br>We developed TIN-X, the Target Importance and Novelty eXplorer, to visualize the association between proteins and diseases, based on text mining data processed from scientific literature. Tin, a chemical element belonging to the carbon family, Group 14 (IVa) of the periodic table. United States Biological's Rabbit Anti-TIN2 Antibody is a Rabbit Polyclonal antibody. name:Protein powder tin box specification: 123x78x158Hmm-,existing mold or any size accepted printed:full color material:tinplate <br> <br>TTN is the gene's official symbol. The Rabbit Anti-TIN2 Antibody was generated using Tin2, TINAG, Tinf2, and tubulointerstitial nephritis … Titin connects the Z line to the M line in the sarcomere. The protein limits the range of motion of the sarcomere in tension, thus contributing to the passive stiffness of muscle. Titin is a protein in the human body responsible for passive muscle elasticity. The full-length scientific name of this protein molecule contains 189,819 characters and is considered … Titin is the largest protein molecule ever discovered. The initial part of it is pronounced almost like Titan, but please do not confuse it with Titan. Titin connects the Z line to the M line in the sarcomere. <br> <br>Titin /ˈtaɪtɪn/, also known as connectin, is a protein  that is encoded by the TTN gene  in humans. However, in the past it has been disputed whether or not it is a real word - proteins are named after the chemicals involved in making them. <br> <br>What is the full name of Titin ? <br> <br>Topology. Titin is a giant protein, greater than 1 µm in length, that functions as a molecular spring which is responsible for the passive elasticity of muscle in addition to keeping myosin molecules in place. <br> <br>Titin is a giant protein, greater than 1 µm  in length,  that functions as a molecular spring  which is responsible for the passive elasticity of muscle  in addition to keeping myosin molecules in place. Titin, also known as connectin, (UniProt name: Q10466_HUMAN; accession number: Q10466) is a protein that is important in the contraction of striated muscle tissues. This is the complete chemical name of titin—the largest known protein. <br> <br>Soon you’ll see why it is the largest…Titin is the short name for an extremely massive protein molecule. This antibody has been shown to work in applications such as: Western Blot. <br> <br>Titin, also known as connectin, (UniProt name: Q10466_HUMAN; accession number: Q10466) is a protein that is important in the contraction of striated muscle tissues. It comprises 244 individually folded protein domains  connected by unstructured peptide  sequences.  <br>However, by protein standards, that’s massive. The … The protein limits the range of motion of the sarcomere in tension, thus contributing to the passive stiffness of muscle. The IUPAC nomenclature for organic chemical compounds is open-ended, giving rise to the 189,819-letter chemical name Methionylthreonylthreonyl...isoleucine for the protein also known as titin, which is involved in striated muscle formation. <br> <br>Official Full Name: tubulointerstitial nephritis antigen-like 1: Background: The protein encoded by this gene is similar in sequence to tubulointerstitial nephritis antigen, a secreted glycoprotein that is recognized by antibodies in some types of immune-related tubulointerstitial nephritis. name:truck shape tin box specification:210x85x100Hmm,existing mold or any size accepted printed:full color material:tinplate Diseases associated with TINAG include Membranous Nephropathy and Interstitial Nephritis.Gene Ontology (GO) annotations related to this gene include nucleotide binding and cysteine-type peptidase activity.An important paralog of this gene is TINAGL1. <br>";s:7:"keyword";s:25:"tin tin protein full name";s:5:"links";s:3796:"<a href='https://eduindiafoundation.org/site/viewtopic.php?efa19b=trevor-tordjman-wife'>Trevor Tordjman Wife</a>,

For instance, most people would agree that lying is wrong. But we are not thereby forced to collapse the distinction between deontology and consequentialism, so long as we can distinguish the two possible ways the relative priority might work out. The term is commonly used in reference to the discussion of general theories about what one ought to do, a central part of Western ethics since ancient times. That objection takes the form of a dilemma, that either Rule-Consequentialism collapses into Act-Consequentialism or it is incoherent. <br> <br>Two examples of consequentialism are utilitarianism and hedonism. <br> <br>[…] 13 f . 3 Re-reading the relevant bits of On Virtue Ethics , I was embarrassed to discover that this is an all-too-understandable mistake. Rule consequentialism gets round the practical problems of act consequentialism because the hard work has been done in deriving the rules; individuals don't generally have to … To the extent that rule-consequentialism circumvents collapse, this theory is accused of incoherence.  <br>Skip to main content Accessibility help We use cookies to distinguish you from other users and … <br> <br> The Collapse of Virtue Ethics - Volume 14 Issue 1 - Brad Hooker. Rule utilitarianism is a form of utilitarianism that says an action is right as it conforms to a rule that leads to the greatest good, or that "the rightness or wrongness of a particular action is a function of the correctness of the rule of which it is an instance". In case of your example, not harming the pregnant woman would be prioritised over globally gaining chocolate bars, such that the overall better outcome rests always on preventing … Utilitarianism is one of the best known and most influential moral theories. Ethics - Ethics - Normative ethics: Normative ethics seeks to set norms or standards for conduct. Philosophers Richard Brandt and Brad Hooker are major proponents of such an approach. Like deontology, rule consequentialism holds that moral behavior involves following certain rules. The consequentialist version of the view would say that one has reason to act honestly because of the antecedent desirability of being oneself honest. <br> 2 Hursthouse , Rosalind , On Virtue Ethics , Oxford , 1999 , pp. But if telling a lie would help save a person’s life, consequentialism says it’s the right thing to do. Attempts to avoid this dilemma based on the idea that using RC has better results than using AC are rejected on the grounds that they conflate the ideas of a criterion of rightness and a decision procedure. each one is born (approximately previously as selfish as the one before (hooker) - the more exceptions there are to the rules the higher are the costs of internalisation "Preventing harm shall be prioritised over gaining benefit". According to this chapter's arguments, rule‐consequentialism need not be guilty of either collapse into extensional equivalence with act‐consequentialism or incoherence. why rule consequentialism does not collapse into act consequentialism - significant costs to ensuring the internalisation of the rules onto new generations. From our perspective, there are other considerations coupled with Consequentialism to complement it, such as: 1. suppose that rule consequentialism will include a rule that says “Break one of the other rules if doing so is necessary to prevent disastrously bad consequences.” Just how bad the consequences need to be to count as disastrously bad will vary depending on what the rule in question is. Rule consequentialism is a theory that is sometimes seen as an attempt to reconcile deontology and consequentialism—and in some cases, this is stated as a criticism of rule consequentialism.

Consequentialism is an ethical theory that judges whether or not something is right by what its consequences are. Why Rule Consequentialism does not collapse into Act Consequentialism - I think the example you gave is flawed. <br> <br>For example, rule utilitarianism is the same as rule consequentialism except rule utilitarianism specifies that decisions should follow rules promoting the most good, instead of the more general assertion that rules should promote a certain desired outcome. Act‐consequentialism recommends that our procedure for making moral decisions employs rules very like the ones endorsed by rule‐consequentialism. Like other forms of consequentialism, its core idea is that whether actions are morally right or wrong depends on their effects.More specifically, the only effects of actions that are relevant are the good and bad results that they produce. The Collapse of Virtue Ethics - Volume 14 Issue 1 - Brad Hooker. Since rule-consequentialism can tell people to follow this simpler and less demanding code, even when following it will not to maximise expected good, rule-consequentialism escapes collapse into practical equivalence to act-consequentialism. <br>";s:7:"keyword";s:30:"rule consequentialism collapse";s:5:"links";s:5874:"<a href='https://eduindiafoundation.org/site/viewtopic.php?efa19b=%D0%B2%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80-%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8C%D0%B5%D0%B2-%D1%84%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BE%D1%84'>владимир соловьев философ</a>,

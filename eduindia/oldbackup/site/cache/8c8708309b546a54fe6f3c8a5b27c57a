The concept of cultural relativism also means that any opinion on ethics is subject to the perspective of each person within their particular culture. Moral relativism is the view that ethical standards, morality, and positions of right or wrong are culturally based and therefore subject to a person's individual choice. According to Siegel, if relativism is right (and therefore there can be no rightness), then relativism itself. There can be in other words relativism at a distance between two historically distinct cultures. Cultural relativism then holds that what a culture believes about an act determines the truth about its objective rightness or wrongness in something like the way that spatio-temporal location determines the truth about the weather conditions obtaining then and there. Ethical relativism eliminates all judgement because there is arguably no final truth, no right or wrong. According to Siegel, if relativism is right (and therefore there can be no rightness), then relativism itself. Normative ethical relativism is a theory, which claims that there are no universally valid moral principles. Basic Human rights. This is also based on the idea that there is no absolute standard of good or evil, therefore every decision and judgment of what is right and wrong is individually decided in each society.

Cultural relativism then holds that what a culture believes about an act determines the truth about its objective rightness or wrongness in something like the way that spatio-temporal location determines the truth about the weather conditions obtaining then and there. b. self-referentially incoherent. So, each individual has the right to determine morality for himself. c. self-justifying. <br> <br>As Doug Powell, author of Holman QuickSource Guide to Christian Apologetics, puts it ethical relativism is the idea that “What’s true for you is true for you, and what’s true for me is true for me” (79). If they are right, then there cannot be extensive disagreements about morality, and the agreements are more significant than the disagreements. If ethical relativism is correct, there can be no common framework for resolving moral disputes or for reaching agreement on ethical matters among members of different societies. CULTURAL RELATIVISM--(can't judge cultures--no one is right and no one is wrong/morality varies culture to culture) **but TRUTH: Somewhere in-between. d. bolstered.

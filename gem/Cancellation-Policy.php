          Cancellation Policy

        <h4 class="text-start fw-bold text-black mt-3">Cancellation Policy</h4>
        <p class="text-black py-3 text-start">We adhere to a no-cancellation policy. Orders placed with us may only be
          canceled if we are unable to provide the service. In cases where delivery from our side is not feasible, a
          refund will be issued to the customer after deducting internet and handling charges (approximately Rs. 500/-).
        </p>
        <p class="text-black py-3 text-start">Please note that non-delivery of services due to deficiencies in submitted
          documents, failure to provide OTP (One Time Password), or any other lack of client cooperation that prevents
          us from delivering services will not be considered our failure. No refund will be available in such instances
          as our performance is not deficient.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-start fw-bold text-black mt-3">Refund Policy</h4>
        <p class="text-black py-3 text-start">We maintain a no-refund policy. However, if a customer submits a written
          request to cancel their order within 4 hours from the time of payment or processing of their application,
          whichever is earlier, our company officials will review the case and determine if a refund is appropriate.
          Even in such cases, the refund amount cannot exceed 50.00% of the amount paid by the customer.
        </p>
        <p class="text-black py-3 text-start">It is explicitly stated that requests for cancellation or refund made
          after 4 hours from payment or after processing the application, whichever is earlier, will not be considered
          for any refund claims. The refund decision made by our company will be final and binding on the customer.
